Mobile Architect &amp; Programming


Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I decided to build a weight loss tracking app. The goal was to allow users to sign up or sign in to an account. Then the user would add their weight and what their weight goals were.  Then there would be a display that would allow the users to know where they were on their journey. 

 What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? To create this app, I had to spend a lot of time on the .xml files. This is what the users will see and will be much more useful to the users. If the backend does not work they will leave. However, if the front end looks terrible, they may never give the app a chance and will never know what the backend can do. 

How did your UI designs keep users in mind?
I tried to keep the UI simple like most apps so that everything was user intuitive. I also tried to use common words so the average user would understand what each button would do. 

 Why were your designs successful? 
My designs were successful because I made it as simple as I possibly could. I did not and anything extra and made sure that there was no fluff to confuse the users. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? 
To code this app, I stuck with a key phrase I learned in my first programming class. KIss. Keep it simple silly. I tried not to get carried away with new things or ideas. I wanted to keep it simple so that it worked with a simple UI. 

How could those be applied in the future?
I think alway keeping code simple and straight to the point will be the best strategy for success in the future. Code sometimes sits for a long time just waiting to be read again and if it is simple and easy to understand now when writing it, it will be simple and easy to understand when days, months, or even years have passed. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional?
To test my code I made sure that I had no errors, then I ran the code and selected every option that I could. 

Why is this process important and what did it reveal? 
This process was important because I learned that I did not have my sign up button live. I only had it set up. Without trying every button  I would have just guessed that everything worked because I am a fantastic coder with little experience, but I would have been mistaken. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I struggle with design. So that was the most complicated part. I did not want to copy another design, however I saw so many apps when doing my research that I did think about just copying the layout of another app. To overcome this I decided to simply just ask random people what their thoughts were. 

 In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was most successful in the backend of the app building. I learned that I am good at connecting the code to the UI. That part just makes sense in my head.
